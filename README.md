# Clock and Alarm Application

This is a simple web-based clock and alarm application that allows users to view the current time, set alarms, manage their alarms, and receive alerts when alarms go off. This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

### Clock Face

- The clock displays the current time and updates in real-time. It shows hours, minutes, and seconds.

### Set Alarm

- Users can set alarms by providing the following inputs:
  - Hour (1-12)
  - Minutes (0-59)
  - Seconds (0-59)
  - AM/PM selection
- Once the user sets the desired time and clicks the "Set Alarm" button, the alarm is added to the list of alarms below.

### Alarms List

- The application maintains a list of all the alarms set by the user. Each alarm is displayed in the format: `HH:MM:SS AM/PM`.

### Delete Alarm

- Each alarm in the list comes with a "Delete" button.
- When the user clicks the "Delete" button for an alarm, that alarm is removed from the list without triggering any alerts.
